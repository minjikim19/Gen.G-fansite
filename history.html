              In mid-2017, Kevin Chou and Kent Wakeford, co-founders of the
              video game development company Kabam, established the esports
              organization KSV (Korea plus Silicon Valley) esports
              International, as they purchased the rights to an Overwatch League
              franchise in Seoul, South Korea, for a reported $20 million. This
              later became the Seoul Dynasty. In October 2017, the company
              expanded into Heroes of the Storm by acquiring the teams MVP Black
              and MVP Miracle; In November 2017, KSV signed a roster for
              Overwatch Contenders, established their PlayerUnknown's
              Battlegrounds team, and acquired Samsung Galaxy's League of
              Legends team.

              KSV eSports came into the LCK 2018 Spring Split with their world
              champ winning roster. KSV eSports managed to qualify for the LCK
              2018 Spring Playoff. They met SKT in the wildcard match and
              conceded defeat with a score of 1:2, thus ending their Spring
              Split run. Gen.G qualified for the LCK 2018 Summer Playoffs and
              ending their regular season with 13 wins and 5 defeats. Gen.G came
              into the 2018 Worlds off one of the best gauntlet runs, but even
              with the homecrowd backing them up, they failed to show up and
              ended the group stage with 1-5.

              Gen.G could not keep up their early form from Kespa Cup and
              struggled throughout the split. They failed to qualify for the LCK
              2019 Spring Playoffs and just barely avoided relegations. They
              ended their Spring regular season with 5-13 record, finishing in
              7th place. Going into Summer Split GEN decided to sign veteran
              Kuzan as mid laner which seemed to pay off as they had better
              performances than in spring. It didn't seem to be enough to reach
              playoffs though which lead to bringing Fly back into mid lane.
              This caused a peak in performance for a few weeks during which
              they won 6 of their 7 series before Fly was subbed back out and
              GEN lost their remaining three series missing out on playoffs,
              gauntlet and another Worlds participation.

              Gen.G's new roster was expected to compete for the title and had a
              had a promising first showing during 2019 LoL KeSPA Cup. They
              confirmed this promising result during the first half of Spring
              Split in LCK as they went 8-1 nearly only dropping games to the
              other top teams. Not even a two week break and a change to online
              play due to the 2019–20 Coronavirus Pandemic could stop their
              momentum until they dropped the matches against both T1 and
              DragonX in week 7 and got upset the week after by HLE. Due to
              their great record against the bottom teams of the league that was
              still enough to secure first place in Regular Season and therefore
              first seed in playoffs though. Back in LoL Park for the finals
              they were outdrafted and outplayed by T1 in a 0-3 sweep which was
              disappointing for the viewers, their fans and of course the team
              themselves.
